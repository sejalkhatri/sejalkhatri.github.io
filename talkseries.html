                <p>Ever wondered if the street you walk on to get to work, school, or the grocery store was once—or is still—walked by pioneers and leaders who shaped industries, fields, and cultural trends?</p>
                <p>In the noise of everyday life, I strive to surface these stories—to ground myself and others in our surroundings and to draw inspiration from them.</p>
                <p>Tune in to this monthly series, where we explore one individual from Seattle and one from the Boston area on the first Saturday of each month in 2026. We’re still experimenting with the format and structure, and as an early listener, you’ll have the chance to help shape what this becomes.</p>
                <p>If there are people from these cities (popular or not) that you’re especially passionate or curious about, share their names through this <a href="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0cbK00LT73IQdi6" target="_blank"> quick form</a>.
